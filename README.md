<h1 style="color: blue;">EXECUTABLES</h1>

<p>These are some of my programs that I have zipped up so you can download them and execute them.  </p>

<h2>Hello world</h2>
<p>This was me just understanding how GitHub actually works</p>
<br/>
<h2>Mason Application</h2>
<p>This application is for Brick masons or brick companies that wish to save money on selling to many bricks; or just to help brick masons out by letting them do less math while bidding a job.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Random Numbers</h2>
<p>this was an app that I did for college.  It is just a application that creates random numbers. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Tesla Voice Recognition</h2>
<p>This is an application that will help your day to day life by taking the hands on away.  Tesla is always listening and you can ask what time it is or tell her/him to open a program for you.  You may have to chnage some of the code for your computer but that is because this is my first Voice Recognition program.  I hope you enjoy my creation and if you want to add on please do.  </p>
